Hi I'm Andy â€” I'm currently the CTO of a software services company in beautiful sunny Kuwait.

I've spent my career as a software engineer and designer and I've built and managed teams, led developer training, founded user groups, and presented at conferences.

I have a passion for the elegance inherent in well-designed software solutions and the beauty that exists in the software we create. I enjoy working with and evangelizing all of the technologies and patterns that create harmony in my software development life and I enjoy sharing my experiences with others.

You'll currently find me building cloud-native software solutions with Azure and .NET Core.
